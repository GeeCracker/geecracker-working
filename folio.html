  <div class="desc">I am a creative, smart university student with a strong desire to learn. I love design and layout tasks like web design and UI design, but also enjoy doing technical work like backend development and data management. One priority of mine is to increase the number of technical skills I can draw on to make my visions into reality. I want to develop my programming skills, as well as knowledge of different systems going into real modern software.</div>

  <div class="itemDesc">On the Queen's Tech and Media Association Iâ€™m working in a small team within a Startup incubator to develop a new interactive social platform. The project is an app which allows its users to post anonymous messages at there exact geographic location at the time of writing. Users can only see messages within a certain radius around their location.</div>

  <div class="itemDesc">A small team project I did towards the end of high school. The goal was to create a webapp which provided online chatrooms for the purpose of creating study group-chats to replace using Instagram. The goal was to provide more specific useful features for people to use. I created all the cosmetic items that people could unlock and customize.</div>

  <div class="itemDesc">The Esports for Highschool Association is one of my proudest achievements from high school. This was an independent start-up project spearheaded by my classmate Bryan Ling. The goal was to provide Canadian high school students a platform to play and compete in professional quality, organized esports events. Our team worked on working with school administration to establish recognized clubs in each participating school. The project consisted of developing a highly functional website, organizing participants into live brackets, coordinating and managing game servers, and tracking individual statistics.</div>

  <div class="itemDesc">I was directly in charge of the game servers for one of the games we were running. I can still remember the immense pride I felt when the first game started, and all participants were successfully in the server playing the game. Being a part of this project was a major reason I developed a strong interest in doing start-up and incubator work. Having a major role in something, and seeing it come to life is such a fantastic feeling. I want to be apart of more projects like this in the future.</div>

  <div class="itemDesc">Today the platform has been rebranded to OLAE (Ontario League of Associated Esports), and still has over a hundred active participants from a collection of schools across Ontario.</div>
