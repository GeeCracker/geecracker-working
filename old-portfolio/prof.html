      <div class="desc">&emsp;I am a creative, smart computer science student with a strong desire to learn. I love design and layout tasks like web design and UI design, but also enjoy doing technical work like backend development and data management. One priority of mine is to increase the number of technical skills I can draw on to make my visions into reality. I want to develop my programming skills, as well as knowledge of different systems going into real modern software.</div>
      <div class="desc">&emsp;To grow my skills, I’ve worked on various technical and design-oriented projects such as building websites and building games. A sample of these can be found on my portfolio page. Through my years of experimenting, I’ve learned a few lessons. First, organization is paramount in a successful development project. Whether it be organization of files, organization of code, or organization of ideas, unless you can easily retrieve whatever you need at that moment, development work can be extremely challenging. Related to organization, another important lesson I learned is the importance of planning. When a project is new and exciting, you just want to start putting stuff together. This rarely works successfully, and usually wasted a lot of time. Being able to cleanly lay out your thoughts and plans makes for a much more streamlined implementation process. The most important lesson I’ve learned is that success comes as a result of perseverance. Many times, I’ve found myself stuck and frustrated at a task I was trying to complete. It always feels like stopping and giving up is the easiest choice, but if I had done that every time I felt this way, I would never have created a lot of projects that I’m very proud of. Being able to search for resources, and powering through difficult challenges often leads to a huge sense of accomplishment and a plethora of new knowledge.</div>
      <div class="desc">&emsp;My main goal is to continue to work on new challenges to learn new things. The more I can apply my knowledge and skills, the more knowledge and skills I acquire as a result. Programming and development work is my passion, and I hope to continue doing it well into the future.</div>
