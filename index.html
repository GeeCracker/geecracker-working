<div class="heading"> <h4>Our Service</h4> </div>

<div class="text">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide lobbying services to various companies whose main source if income is being threatened by new dangerous government policies put in place because of the protesting of the aggressive environmentalists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment is doing just fine. Global warming? Climate change? It still snows in winter, and it's always rained in April. Where is the evidence. The truth that "environmentalists" don't want you to know is that, there is no evidence. Even though this is the case, governments treat climate change as fact. Even worse, they think honest industries like oil, mining, and manufacturing are responsible. At Lobby Firm, we know that your business has nothing to do with climate change, if it even is a real thing. We are here to protect your business from the unfair regulations the government forces upon you, to ensure a happy, successful future. </p>
